## Setup
- **Group Size:** Best played with 10-12 people. Minimum of 7. More than 12 can become chaotic.
- **Roles:** Each player gets **2 roles** determined by cards. The host selects specific cards from a deck:
  - **Black King (K):** Killer (Active in any position)
  - **Red Kings (K):** Killer (Active only on top)
  - **Black Jacks (J):** Policemen (Active in any position)
  - **Red Jacks (J):** Policemen (Active only on top)
  - **Red Queen (Q):** Doctor
  - **Red Ace (A):** Assassin
  - **Joker:** Hunter
  - **Number Cards:** Villagers
- Shuffle and deal **2 cards per person**. Each player chooses which card to play first by stacking them face down.  
  **Important:** If someone gets both a King and a Jack, reshuffle and redeal the cards.
- **Host Role:** The host manages the game, narrates the events, and ensures rules are followed.

## Gameplay Overview
The game alternates between **Night** (roles act) and **Day** (discussion and voting).  
The goal is for Villagers and Policemen to eliminate Killers, or for Killers to eliminate Policemen and dominate the town.

## Night Phase
1. **All players close their eyes.**  
   The host calls out roles to wake up and act silently, in this order:

   ### **Killers (Black/Red Kings):**  
   - Black King is always active; Red King only active if on top.  
   - Decide unanimously who to poison. Inform the host by pointing.  

   ### **Doctor (Red Queen):**  
   - Wake up and choose one person to vaccinate.  
   - If the vaccinated player wasn’t poisoned, they get an **extra dose**.  
     **Two doses = overdose and death.** The doctor must track vaccinations carefully.  

   ### **Policemen (Black/Red Jacks):**  
   - Black Jack is always active; Red Jack only active if on top.  
   - Investigate one person by pointing to the host. The host gives a **thumbs up** if their top card is a Killer, **thumbs down** otherwise.  

   ### **Assassin (Red Ace):**  
   - Can eliminate one player. This kill **cannot be cured.**  
   - On the first night, the Assassin may choose to refrain from killing. From the second night onwards, they must act.  

2. **All players open their eyes.**  
   The host announces the deaths (without revealing the causes or roles).  
   - The top card of the deceased is removed. If a player loses their second card, they are eliminated.

---

## Day Phase
1. **Funeral Speeches:**  
   - The first 5 eliminated players get a 20-second farewell speech. They can say anything but cannot reveal their roles.  

2. **Discussion:**  
   - Surviving players discuss who might be a Killer. Killers try to mislead the group, while others attempt to uncover the truth.  
   - The host allows **3 minutes** for open discussion.  

3. **Uninterrupted Speeches:**  
   - Each player gets 20 seconds to share their thoughts or suspicions.

4. **Voting:**  
   - Players vote on who to eliminate.  
     - **1 card = 1 vote, 2 cards = 2 votes.** Players can split votes or abstain.  
   - The player with the most votes loses their top card.  
   - **Tiebreaker:** If there’s a tie, only tied players participate in a second vote. Each tied player gets 20 seconds to defend themselves.  
     Everyone else must use all votes and if the tie persists, find a fair way to decide (e.g., random selection).  

5. **Next Night Begins:**  
   The host repeats the process, calling out all roles (even if the role is eliminated) to maintain the game’s mystery.

## Role-Specific Rules
- **Killers:** Remain in the Killer group even if you lose your King card.
- **Doctor:** Be cautious of overdosing players with unnecessary vaccines.
- **Policemen:** Investigate strategically to identify Killers.
- **Assassin:** Use your kills wisely to influence the game.  
- **Hunter (Joker):** When the Hunter dies, they can choose one player to take with them to death.

---

## Winning Conditions
- **Villagers/Policemen Win:** All Killers are eliminated.  
- **Killers Win:** All Policemen are eliminated.  

---

## Tips for the Host
- Speak clearly and maintain the pace of the game.  
- Use consistent phrases for role calls (e.g., “Killers, wake up… Killers, close your eyes”). This avoids giving away clues about active roles.  
- Keep track of eliminated cards and ensure fairness.

This refined version keeps the game exciting and ensures clarity for both veterans and newcomers. Enjoy your Mafia nights!
